# Calories Burnt Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Overview
This project predicts calories burned based on various factors such as heart rate, age, weight, duration, and physical activity level. By analyzing fitness-related data, we developed a highly accurate regression model to help individuals track their calorie expenditure effectively.

# Dataset Details
The dataset consists of activity and physiological data collected from individuals during exercise sessions.

# Key features include:
Age, Gender, Height, Weight
Heart Rate, Exercise Duration, Activity Type
Calories Burned (Target Variable)

# Technologies & Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
* Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
* Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# Project Workflow
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalizing numeric features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends & correlations between activity levels and calorie burn.
* Feature Engineering – Selecting impactful features to improve model performance.
* Model Training & Optimization – Implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector models.
* Evaluation Metrics – Used Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model accuracy.

# Results & Key Findings
* Random Forest Model achieved 99% accuracy, outperforming other models.
* Heart Rate, Duration, and Weight were the most significant predictors of calorie burn.
